                            Fight Companions was spawned from the depths of the minds of Anthony, Hector and Adam after being inspired by the one and only Joe Rogan.  Having been fans of the sport for years and watching it evolve onto the worldwide stage, it seemed fitting to share our love of the sport with the rest of the internet.  That, and we needed an excuse to drink and watch UFC.<br/><br/>So sign up, log on, and join in the conversation while we three kings of slosh enjoy the ultimate sport. #newblood

                                    Anthony is the energy behind Fight Companions and a self-proclaimed MMA guru. Passionate about sports and all things that include physical contact ;) He's a tell it like it is kind of guy and won't shy away from a good debate. Like his favorite comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, Anthony will have you laughing your ass off with his mix of sarcasm of quick wit!

                                    Adam Fabian has been called a lot of things: Great, Wonderful, Stellar, even Fantastic.  But one thing Adam prides himself on is being able to bullshit with the best of em.  Repping Pittsburgh incessantly, while non-stop yammering about anything he can, Adam is sure to liven up the UFC discussion.
